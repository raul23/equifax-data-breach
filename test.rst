  On September 7, 2017, Equifax, one of the largest credit reporting agencies in 
  America, announced that an unauthorized third party gained access to Equifax 
  data on as many as 143 million Americans. [M]_
  
  Equifax learned about the breach on July 29 but didn't reveal it for more than 
  a month. [N]_
  
  The number of affected people is roughly half of the US population of 323 
  million. [N]_
