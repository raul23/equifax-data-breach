`:warning:`

  The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) is very careful not to imply 
  that the Chinese army is directly responsible for the data breach.
  Thus, the `DOJ indictment`_ and their `press release`_ target specifically 
  members of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA); more precisely they 
  are part of PLA’s 54th Research Institute, a component of the Chinese 
  military.
  
  The majority of mainstream news sites are also careful in their titles so as 
  to be specific in who are being accused by the DOJ:

  - `Chinese Military Hackers Charged in Equifax Breach`_ (FBI News)
  - `Chinese Military Officers Hacked Equifax, Justice Department Say`_ (
    Defense One)
  - `Equifax: US charges four Chinese military officers over huge hack`_ (BBC 
    News)
  - `Four Members of China's Military Indicted for Massive Equifax Breach`_ (
    The Wall Street Journal)
  - `Justice Department charges 4 members of Chinese military for massive 
    Equifax hack`_ (CBS NEWS)
  - `U.S. Charges Chinese Military Officers in 2017 Equifax Hacking`_ (The New 
    York Times)
  
  Though you still have some news articles with titles implying that it is the 
  whole Chinese army that is being targeted by the DOJ:

  - `US says China's military was behind 2017 Equifax hack that left personal 
    information of 145 million Americans exposed`_ (Business Insider)
  - `What is the PLA, and why do feds believe they hacked Equifax?`_ (The 
    Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
  - `The US says the Chinese military hacked Equifax. Here’s how.`_ (MIT 
    Technology Review)
  - `Report: Chinese Army Stole Over 13 Million British Citizens’ 
    Personal Data`_ (Breitbart)

`:warning:`

  Also, it is very important to keep in mind that what is written in the DOJ 
  `indictment`_ is based on allegations and people (especially media pundits) 
  should not repeat what is in the document as gospel.
  
That's why the DOJ `press release`_ says the following in the bottom of the
page (emphasis mine):
  
  The details contained in the charging document are **ALLEGATIONS**.  
  The defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a 
  reasonable doubt in a court of law.
    
And here is the definiton for the word "allegation" (emphasis mine):
  
  a statement, made **WITHOUT GIVING PROOF**, that someone has done 
  something wrong or illegal [CA]_

The US indictment
-----------------
On February 10, 2020, the DOJ indicted four members of 
China's military on nine charges related to the hack. [DOJ]_

From the DOJ press release about the `indictment`_ 
(`archive <https://web.archive.org/web/20210725031951/https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1246891/download>`__) 
of the four Chinese military members [DOJ]_:

  The nine-count indictment alleges that Wu Zhiyong (吴志勇), Wang Qian (王乾), 
  Xu Ke (许可) and Liu Lei (刘磊) were members of the PLA’s 54th Research 
  Institute, a component of the Chinese military.  They allegedly conspired 
  with each other to hack into Equifax’s computer networks, maintain 
  unauthorized access to those computers, and steal sensitive, personally 
  identifiable information of approximately 145 million American victims.

DOJ evidence that China's military personnel are behind the Equifax data breach
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`:information_source:`

  These are evidence that I was able to gather from the DOJ `indictment`_. 
  
  **TODO:** gather evidence from other governmental sources if they are found
  
1. Multiple China-based IP addresses were allegedly accessed during the 
   intrusion of Equifax's networks by the conspirators:

   - The majority of the 9000 SQL queries [to the credit monitoring databases] 
     were issued by conspirators using two **China-based IP addresses** that 
     connected directly to Equifax' s network. [DOJ2]_ (*paragraph 9, page 6*)

     **NOTE:** the indictment doesn't name these two **China-based IP 
     addresses** like in other places of the document (e.g. China Server #1)
   - **China Server #1:** On or about June 16, 2017, a conspirator using a 
     China-based IP address ("China Server #1"), which was repeatedly accessed 
     during the intrusion by WANG QIAN, logged into a Taiwanese IP address (
     "the Taiwan Server") via Remote Desktop Protocol software and copied the 
     malicious file "jndi. txt." [DOJ2]_ (*paragraph 14.e, page 8*)
   - **China Server #2:** On or about July 7, 2017, another China-based IP 
     address ("China Server #2"), which was also repeatedly accessed during 
     the intrusion by WANG QIAN, exploited the Apache Struts vulnerability on 
     Equifax' s online dispute portal. [DOJ2]_ (*paragraph 14.j, page 9*)
   - **China Server #3:** On or about July 9, 2017, XUKE used a different 
     China-based IP address ("China Server #3") to conduct reconnaissance on 
     Equifax' s online dispute portal. [DOJ2]_ (*paragraph 14.k, page 10*)
   - **China Server #4:** On or about July 10, 2017, a conspirator using 
     another China-based IP address ("China Server #4") logged into the Taiwan 
     Server and copied the malicious file "abc.txt" to the Taiwan Server. 
     [DOJ2]_ (*Paragraph 14.l, page 10*)
   - **China Server #5:** On or about July 10, 2017, a conspirator using 
     another China-based IP address ("China Server #5'') then utilized the 
     malicious web shell ''css.jsp," which was previously installed on 
     Equifax's network, to issue a command to download the "abc. txt" file 
     from the Taiwan Server. [DOJ2]_ (*paragraph 14.l, page 10*)
   - **China Server #6:** On or about July 10, 2017, a conspirator who was 
     logged into another China-based IP address ("China Server #6") utilized 
     the malicious web shell ''boxover.jsp" to query an Equifax database table 
     and store the results in output files. [DOJ2]_ (*paragraph 14.n, page 10*)
 
   `:information_source:`
   
     Reading the DOJ `indictment`_, you have the impression that the US 
     authorities were somehow able to exactly pinpoint who among the four 
     alleged members of the PLA logged to Equifax's networks at a particular 
     time of the day.
     
     However for some other days of the attack, the US investigators lose 
     their special skill to exactly identify who is logging into Equifax's 
     networks and instead used the word "conspirator".
   
   `:information_source:`

     The conspirators also allegedly accessed IP addresses from locations 
     outside of China:
   
     - Switzerland ("the Swiss Server"), [DOJ2]_ (*paragraph 14.f, page 9*)
     
       According to the DOJ `indictment`_, the conspirators logged into the 
       Swiss Server 5 times.
       
     - Taiwan ("the Taiwan Server"), [DOJ2]_ (*paragraph 14.e, page 8*)
     
       According to the DOJ `indictment`_, the conspirators logged into the 
       Taiwan Server 3 times.

     - Netherlands [DOJ2]_ (*paragraph 14.m, page 10*)
     
       According to the DOJ `indictment`_, the conspirators logged into the 
       Dutch server one time.
     
     - Singapore ("the Singapore Server") [DOJ2]_ (*paragraph 14.o, page 11*)
     
       According to the DOJ `indictment`_, the conspirators logged into the 
       Singapore Server 2 times.
       
2. By stealing Equifax's **trade secrets** (including the personally 
   identifiable data and the proprietary database schema), it is claimed by 
   the DOJ that the alleged Chinese hackers are seemingly working with the 
   Chinese government and the PLA because this is the kind of data that 
   these entities are interested in (emphasis mine):
   
     ... with said **TRADE SECRETS** [...], intending and knowing that the 
     offense would **BENEFIT A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT**, instrumentality, and 
     agent, namely **CHINA AND THE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY**, in violation 
     of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1831(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3).
     
     [DOJ2]_ (*paragraph 20, pages 13-14*)
     
     |
     
     ... the defendants [...] intending and knowing that the offense would 
     **BENEFIT A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT**, instrumentality, and agent, namely 
     **CHINA AND THE PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY**, did knowingly and without 
     authorization copy, duplicate, download, upload, replicate, transmit, 
     deliver, send, mail, communicate, and convey a **TRADE SECRET** ...
     
     [DOJ2]_ (*paragraph 23, pages 14-15*)

DOJ evidence verdict: weak
--------------------------
The evidence gathered from the DOJ `indictment`_ is very weak to support the 
claim that the four alleged members of the PLA were the perpetrators of the 
Equifax data breach.

1. Not much personal information has been given about the four suspected PLA 
   members: Wu Zhiyong (吴志勇), Wang Qian (王乾), Xu Ke (许可) and Liu Lei 
   (刘磊).

   The DOJ `indictment`_ and mainstream news articles only provide their names, 
   pictures (one for each), and their place of residence:
  
     Defendants [...] were residents of Beijing, China 
    
     [DOJ2]_ (*parapraph 5.d, pages 3-4*)
    
   However, since it has been a long time since the indictment was unsealed 
   (10 Feb. 2020) and there has not been any update or confirmation on their 
   place of residence (that I am aware of), the whereabouts of the suspects 
   are currently uncertain.
  
   Also, from the DOJ `indictment`_ and `press release`_, the four suspects
   are allegedly members of PLA's 54th Research Institute:
  
     Defendants [...] were members of the 54th Research Institute, which 
     was a component of the PLA. 
    
     [DOJ2]_ (*parapraph 5.d, pages 3-4*)
  
   |
  
     ... Wu Zhiyong (吴志勇), Wang Qian (王乾), Xu Ke (许可) and Liu Lei (刘磊) 
     were members of the PLA’s 54th Research Institute, a component of 
     the Chinese military. [DOJ]_
    
   Again, the same remark for their alleged place of residence applies to their
   membership to the PLA's 54th Research Institute: they might or not still
   work for the PLA.
  
   Their `FBI most wanted`_ poster and the `FBI news article`_ only give their 
   names and pictures but don't mention Beijing which should have been included 
   since it is presumably an important information for people to help the FBI 
   identify the four suspects. At least, the FBI should have said that the 
   four alleged PLA hackers used to live in Beijing, China.
  
   More information (basic and detailed) is about the four alleged PLA hackers 
   such as: 
  
   - General questions about their life: How old are they? Where did they grew 
     up? Where did they study? Where did they work, apart from the PLA?
     Did they leave China at one point in their life?
   - Are Wang Qian and Liu Lei (the only ones not wearing military uniforms in 
     the pictures) civilians working for PLA's 54th Research Institute or 
     active-duty members of the PLA? 
   - What are their military ranks in the PLA? 
   - Were they receiving orders from higher up or were they acting on their 
     own? 
   - Where are those pictures provided in the `indictment`_ of three of 
     the four PLA members coming from? 
  
   All those questions are important for the FBI, DOJ, CIA, and any other relevant 
   three letter agencies to answer to the public because this is the kind of 
   information that will be useful for anyone around the world to be able to 
   recognize any of the alleged PLA hackers. Only in China, there are 
   approximately `1.412 billion people`_ (as of November 2020) and the more 
   personal information you give, higher will be the chance for someone to produce
   helpful tips.
  
   But right now, the personal info the DOJ et al. have provided is very weak and
   doesn't help much the public to identify the four alleged hackers.
  
   There is still the possibility that any of the alleged hackers might leave China 
   in the near future and go to a place that they think has no extradition treaty 
   with the US, not knowing that the US can still apprehend them (they are a world
   superpower after all). Take the case of the Russian hacker 
   `Roman Seleznev`_ that thought that he was safe in the Maldives because they 
   don't have an extradition treaty with the U.S. `He thought wrong`_.

        you get all four pictures (though <a href="https://archive.md/3qA8b">at first</a> the FBI also only shown three pics). Very odd that the DOJ et al. worked for 2 years investigating the Equifax data breach
        and could not get a picture for Liu Lei to include in their indictment.</b></p>

   And to finish this mega huge bullet number on a lighter note, `SecureWorld`_ believes 
   that the pictures provided by the DOJ and FBI support the idea that the four 
   supposedly identified hackers are all working in the Chinese military. Also, 
   they state that the cyberattack on Equifax's networks was pulled off from Shanghai, 
   China.

      </div>

2. There is no explanation in the `indictment`_ how the US authorities came to 
   the conclusion that the four alleged PLA members were directly related to the 
   network intrusions of Equifax's computers.
   
   Since it is an indictment, the DOJ is not obligated to detail how they
   determined the alleged four PLA members were responsible for the Equifax data
   breach. Only if the four alleged hackers are brought to a court of law, will the
   DOJ have to prove **beyond a reasonable doubt** that they attacked Equifax's 
   networks and stole their data. However, it is very unlikely that the four
   suspects will be arrested one day [V]_.
   
   In the US criminal law, the “probable cause” standard is used to arrive at an 
   indictment instead of the most stringent standard of "beyond a reasonable 
   doubt" which is used in a court of law.

     The “probable cause” standard is one of the lowest standards in criminal law, 
     defined as requiring only sufficient evidence to lead a reasonable person to 
     believe that a crime has been committed and that the defendant is guilty. 
     This stands in stark contrast to “beyond a reasonable doubt,” which is 
     necessary to convict a defendant at trial. [BG]_

3. Some of the evidence is based on multiple IP addresses allegedly originating 
   from China.

   It seems very sloppy for the four alleged members of the PLA to reportedly 
   log multiple times into Equifax's systems directly from China-based IP 
   addresses. These conspirators are not your average Joe that doesn't know much 
   about network forensics but are supposedly part of PLA's 54th Research 
   Institute which has traditionally focused on supporting electronic warfare 
   akin to Cyber Command as opposed to cyber espionage [VD]_. 
  
   Therefore, these four alleged PLA members should know very well how to hide 
   their tracks and use only IP addresses from outside China. 
  
   The four suspected PLA hackers and their alleged co-conspirators were able 
   to navigate throughout Equifax's networks as mere ghosts. To achieve their 
   cloak of anonymity, they supposedly: 
  
     - routed traffic through approximately 34 servers located in nearly 20 
       countries to obfuscate their true location, 
     - used encrypted communication channels within Equifax’s network to blend 
       in with normal network activity, and 
     - deleted compressed files and wiped log files on a daily basis in an 
       effort to eliminate records of their activity. [DOJ]_
      
   But according to the DOJ `indictment`_, the four alleged `elite`_ 
   hackers and their supposedly co-conspirators **DIRECTLY** accessed 
   China-based IP addresses multiple times during their 2-month attack. This 
   is a very basic and surprising mistake to commit when "hiding their tracks" is 
   supposed to be the most important thing to accomplish because the network 
   intrusions rest on constantly keeping the anonymity of the attackers. 
   Accessing servers only from outside of China was not rigidly followed by 
   the alleged group of hackers unless they really wanted to be identified 
   and didn't care about repercussions (emphasis mine):
  
     1. The majority of the 9000 SQL queries [to the credit monitoring databases] 
        were issued by conspirators using two **CHINA-BASED** IP addresses that 
        connected **DIRECTLY** to Equifax' s network.
    
        [DOJ2]_ (paragraph 9, page 6)
      
     2. ... another **CHINA-BASED** IP address ("China Server #2"), which was 
        also repeatedly accessed during the intrusion by WANG QIAN, exploited 
        the Apache Struts vulnerability on Equifax's online dispute portal. 
      
        [DOJ2]_ (paragraph 14.j, pages 9-10)
      
     3. ... XU KE used a different **CHINA-BASED** IP address ("China Server #3") 
        to conduct reconnaissance on Equifax's online dispute portal. 
       
        [DOJ2]_ (paragraph 14.k, page 10)
      
     4. A conspirator using another **CHINA-BASED** IP address ("China Server #5") 
        then utilized the malicious web shell "css.jsp," whichwas previously 
        installed on Equifax's network ...
      
        [DOJ2]_ (paragraph 14.l, page 10)
      
     5. ... a conspirator using **CHINA** Server #5 uploaded a substantively 
        identical web shell, "ss.jsp," to the Equifax network. 
    
        [DOJ2]_ (paragraph 14.l, page 10)
       
     6. ... a conspirator who was logged into another **CHINA-BASED** IP address 
        ("China Server #6") utilized the malicious web shell "boxover.jsp" to 
        query an Equifax database table ...
        
        [DOJ2]_ (paragraph 14.n, page 10)
       
     7. ... WANG QIAN, using **CHINA** Server #2, remotely accessed the 
        malicious web shell "six.jsp" on an Equifax server ...
       
        [DOJ2]_ (paragraph 14.o, page 11)
    
   The suspected hackers supposedly had the backing of the `second most 
   important army in the world in terms of budget`_ (for 2020) but they were 
   not able to think of various ways of definitely hiding their tracks that 
   didn't require frequently logging from the same country. It would had been 
   extremely careless of China to not make sure to be as anonymous as possible 
   because they certainly knew that if they didn't, they risked further 
   deteriorating their tense diplomatic relations with the currently only 
   military superpower that is the USA which had `accused China`_ of multiple 
   cyberattacks against the US and allies (e.g. the `2015 massive breach at the 
   U.S. Office of Personnel Management`_).
  
In conclusion, since it is extremely unlikely for the four alleged PLA members
to get arrested by US authorities, the quality of any evidence in the 
`indictment`_ can be very subpar. The case will likely not go in front of a 
judge and jury where the evidence presented by the prosecutors would have 
been scrutinized.

Thus, the DOJ is not incentivized to gather solid evidence that could link 
the four alleged PLA members to the Equifax data breach:

  Officials acknowledged they were unlikely to face prosecution in a U.S. 
  courtroom. [V]_ 

Reading the many mainstream news articles (even outside the USA like UK and 
Canada), you get the feeling that everyone just went along with the narrative of 
the DOJ that four PLA members are unequivocally responsible for the Equifax 
data breach.

However, `RT.com`_ is among the only news sites that questioned the link 
between the four alleged PLA members and the data breach as promulgated by the 
DOJ:

  It remains unclear how the DOJ concluded that four members of the Chinese 
  military were responsible, whether they were supposedly acting on their own or 
  on state orders, or how it intends to bring them to a US court. [RT]_

Since it is from RT, people (especially in the US) will have a tendency to 
discard whatever they have to say because they are `"the Kremlin's 
foreign-language propaganda network"`_.

Also `tom's guide`_ asked important questions about the DOJ's often repeated 
claim that the four suspected Chinese hackers were allegedly military members 
of the PLA:

  It is not clear whether the four individuals are civilians working for the 
  PLA or active-duty members of the Chinese military. No military ranks were 
  given for any of the defendants in the indictment, but the four were said to 
  be members of the PLA's 54th Research Institute. (Update: A `wanted poster 
  put up online by the FBI`_ shows photos allegedly of Wu and Xu wearing 
  military uniforms.) [WP]_

Non-DOJ evidence that China's military personnel are behind the Equifax data breach
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`:information_source:`

  These are evidence that I was able to gather from non governmental sources such as 
  from mainstream newspapers. However, as you may see, the information provided by
  journalisys will probably come from anonymous sources and hence their statements
  may prove difficult (or almost impossible) to corroborate.
