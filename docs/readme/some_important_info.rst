----------
  
- On March 9, 2017, the company's IT team was informed of a vulnerability 
  affecting the `Apache Struts software`_ it used on its dispute resolution 
  portal, with instructions to patch it in 48 hours. That didn't happen. [H]_
  
  The unpatched Apache Struts server was powering its five-decades-old(!) 
  web-facing system that allowed consumers to check their credit rating from 
  the company’s website. [WZ]_
  
- On May 13, 2017, the attackers hit the jackpot with Equifax's dispute portal, 
  where people could go to argue about claims. [N]_
- The breach was discovered on `29 July 2017`_. [M]_
- On September 7, 2017, Equifax, one of the largest credit reporting agencies 
  in America, announced that an unauthorized third party gained access to 
  Equifax data on as many as 143 million Americans. [M]_
- As a result, the `CEO`_, `CIO and CSO`_ had to go. [T]_
- In both October 2017 [WE]_ and March 2018 [MM]_, Equifax reported that an 
  additional 2.5 and 2.4 million American consumer records were accessed, 
  respectively, bringing the total to 147.9 million. [W]_
